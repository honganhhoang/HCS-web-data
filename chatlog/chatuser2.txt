User>>what is individual councelling?

Bot>> The concept of individual counseling refers to a one-on-one therapeutic process where a person works closely with a trained counselor or therapist to explore and address personal issues, challenges, or concerns in a confidential and supportive setting. Individual counseling sessions typically focus on the individual's emotional well-being, personal growth, self-exploration, and development of coping strategies to manage difficulties effectively. It provides a safe space for individuals to express their thoughts and feelings, gain insights into their behaviors and emotions, and work towards achieving their personal goals.
