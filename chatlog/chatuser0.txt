Bot>> Hello! How can I assist you today?

User>>hi. I want to know if they have group therapy.

Bot>> Based on the information provided from the SFU counselling website, there are indeed group therapy options available for students. To access group therapy sessions, students can browse the list of options, self-refer, or drop in to get connected. Additionally, students can register for specific group counseling sessions by contacting their CAL disability advisor and expressing interest in participating in the group. The advisor will then forward an email referral with instructions on booking an intake appointment with the group facilitator.

If you would like more details or have specific questions about group therapy options, feel free to explore the resources provided on the SFU counselling website: [SFU Counselling Services](https://www.sfu.ca/students/health/support-resources/counselling-services.html).
