We facilitate disability-related accommodations and supports that create a fair and equitable academic experience for students with disabilities at SFU.  We work with students, instructors and other units on campus to explore ways to remove disability-related barriers in all aspects of university life.

CAL's work is guided by, SFU's General Policy 26, "Accessibility for Students with Disabilities".
