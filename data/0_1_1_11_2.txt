Every decision we make in our roles can impact health and well-being and positively contribute to a healthy campus community. 

A healthy campus community is one where the people, processes, policies, environments and spaces contribute to well-being and success for all. Watch a short video (3:34min) illustrating how all systems within post-secondary are connected to health and well-being.

SFU’s Healthy Campus Community (HCC) vision: “Simon Fraser University is a healthy campus community where the people, programs, practices, policies, and spaces foster well-being, supporting campus members to thrive and succeed at SFU and beyond.”

As a staff, faculty or student leader, you may directly interact with students. Creating a supportive community involves caring and responsive members that are prepared to assist and support someone in distress who may be experiencing mental health challenges. 

Learn how you can support students in distress, identify signs and assist a student in need by connecting them to available support services and resources. 

A critical incident typically involves a traumatic event that creates a strong emotional reaction. It may interfere with the ability to manage day-to-day activities or have a negative impact on those involved. A supportive community looks out for its members and responds to critical incidents with empathy and compassion. Learn more about critical incidents and how to respond and support those involved.

Health and Counselling Services is here to educate you and raise awareness about health and well-being, mental health, resilience and self-care, supporting students in distress, support over suicide, and more. 

View available on-demand workshops and outreach opportunities and request one for your faculty, department, unit or team.

Your health and well-being also matters. You must care for yourself in order to be able to care for others. Explore health and well-being resources and support services for SFU faculty and staff.
