The ISC Honouring Feast is a special event held bi-annually to honour and celebrate Indigenous students in their degree completion at SFU. Join us as we raise our hands with respect and in commemoration of the achievements of our graduating Indigenous students.

Congratulations graduating students! The ISC Honouring Feast will be happening the afternoon of October 8th, 2025 for self-identified Indigenous students who graduated in Summer 2025.

Please ensure that you are checking your email as invitations will go out at the end of August. We cannot wait to witness the Indigenous brilliance shine as each of you take the next step on your journey. 

If you have any questions or concerns please email isc_projects@sfu.ca.
