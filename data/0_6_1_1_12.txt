The Indigenous Learning Living Community (ILLC) is designed for Indigenous students (First Nations, Métis and Inuit) who want to connect with other Indigenous students, engage with and share their own Indigenous heritage and knowledge, and participate in cultural and educational opportunities guided by SFU’s Indigenous Student Centre. As a member of this community you will connect with other Indigenous students and build community through peer support, mentorship and leadership development opportunities.
