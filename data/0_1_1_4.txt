SFU is committed to creating and maintaining a healthy, safe and respectful learning, teaching, research and work environment in which bullying and harassment are neither acceptable nor tolerated. 

Support and services are available to anyone impacted by bullying and harassment at SFU. Bullying and harassment includes any inappropriate conduct or comment by a person towards a member of the University Community (student, staff or faculty) that the person knew or reasonably ought to have known would cause the member of the University Community to be humiliated or intimidated.

No matter how big or small the incident is, we are here to support you. Making a report is your right and, you do not need to make a report in order to access support. You can meet with the Anti-Bullying Specialist who can support you in submitting a report or you can submit confidential inquiry through the Bullying & Harassment Report Webform.
