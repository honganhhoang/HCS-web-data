Is this an emergency?    For life-threatening illnesses or injuries, including symptoms of a heart attack, call 9-1-1 or go to your nearest emergency room right away.

Urgent and Primary Care Centres (UPCCs) provide access to same-day, urgent, non-emergency health care. UPCCs are often open evening, weekends and statutory holidays (actual hours vary by clinic). 

UPCCs provide an alternative to visiting an emergency department for non-emergency issues. For example, patients who require medical attention within 12 to 24 hours for something like a sprain, minor cut or burn can visit an Urgent and Primary Care Centre.

Note the following:

Urgent and Primary Care Centres are available in many communities across British Columbia as part of the Province’s Primary Care Strategy. UPCCs are regularly being launched across the province. Keep checking this page for more updates.
