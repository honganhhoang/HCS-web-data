Every February 14th the Women's Memorial March takes place. The first women’s memorial march was held in 1992 in response to the murder of a woman on Powell Street in Vancouver. Out of this sense of hopelessness and anger came an annual march on Valentine’s Day to express compassion, community, and caring for all women in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside on unceded Coast Salish territories. We encourage others to join us in supporting this event and continue raising awareness.

The following list has been compiled by the Pacific Association of First Nations Women.
