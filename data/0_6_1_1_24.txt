Are you an Indigenous student, staff or faculty member at SFU? If so, you are invited to Monthly Lunches, which are an opportunity for the SFU Indigenous community to connect with one another and share in a meal. These lunches will be student centered, giving students the chance to meet various faculty and staff.

These gatherings are hosted by the Indigenous Student Centre and First Nations, Métis & Inuit Student Association, and co-hosted by maybe you!?

Email isccomms@sfu.ca to be added

If you are interested in attending a lunch, please refer to the ISC Calender of Events to learn more about upcoming lunches and to register!

As we continue to grow and foster our community, we encourage other SFU departments and faculties to take lead in hosting these events. If your department is interested in hosting one of these gatherings, please email Audrey Heath, Indigenous Administration & Events Coordinator at isc_projects@sfu.ca.
