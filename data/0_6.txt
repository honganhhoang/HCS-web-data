I 

Are you deaf or hard of hearing? Do you have accessibility needs or challenges using the phone? Health & Counselling is in the process of setting up an online booking system to accommodate various student needs. You now have the option to book online with some care providers, but medical appointments (with doctors and nurses) still require a submission on our appointment request form:

Appointment requests are NOT CONFIRMED until after the medical office assistant contacts you by email within 2-3 business days.

If you do not have accessibility needs, please call the front desk to book: 778-782-4615. 

Burnaby campus: 778.782.4615
Vancouver campus: 778.782.5200
Surrey campus: 778.782.5200
