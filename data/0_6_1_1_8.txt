The Peer Cousins Mentorship Program connects senior SFU Indigenous students with students who may be new to the SFU community, have questions about university, or are looking to meet other Indigenous students.

Indigenous students new to SFU are invited to register for the ISC's Peer Cousins Program! Get connected with senior students to build relationships and learn about the opportunities available at SFU.

Hi! My name is Kaia Haintz, I am Coast Salish from Hwlitsum First Nation on my mom's side and European descent on my dad's side. I currently am in my 3rd year here at SFU majoring in Indigenous Studies and minoring in Early Learning. In my time outside of school, I play on the SFU rugby team and enjoy beading earrings. I look forward to meeting and supporting my Indigenous peers.

More coming soon...
