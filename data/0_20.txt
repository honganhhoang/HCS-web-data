The Indigenous Student Centre (ISC) recently updated its Protocol Guide to ensure that Elders and Knowledge Sharers have consistency in requests and are treated with respect during their time at SFU. These guidelines have been created by ISC staff in consultation with the current Elder's and Knowledge Sharer's in Residence. When making a booking please ensure to read and follow the guide provided.

Elders Program Protocol Guide

If you would like to invite an Elder to support your event, please complete the Elders Request Form at least two weeks before the event date. 

   

  

To ensure the comfort and safety of Elders while attending in-person events, we are asking that event organizers coordinate and cover the cost of transportation (i.e. Uber) to and from the event, as well as provide refreshments (i.e. snack and/or lunch) as required.

To ensure proper and respectful recognition of the Elders time and energy, please identify how long the Elder is being requested for your event.
