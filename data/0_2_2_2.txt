Thank you so much.
I cannot tell you what a feeling of relief you have brought me.
I swear I was googling every day I felt the worry about it (pregnancy risk) come again… I just got so scared…
And I know I’m dragging out the conversation, but I really can’t thank you enough….
But I think I’ll be okay
Thanks again
