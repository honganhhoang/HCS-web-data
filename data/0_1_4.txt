Find various support options for disabled and neurodivergent students here, including a list of FAQs .

While any and all students are welcome through the doors of Health and Counselling, we recognize that some students registered with CAL may have disability-specific issues, or may feel more comfortable engaging in counselling with a counsellor with lived experience of disability.

Sean Heaslip is a registered clinical counsellor, and also happens to be partially blind, and is the CAL counsellor at Health and Counselling. Sean offers both individual and group counselling options, and can meet with you to discuss what options will best support your present needs.

Individual counselling

Individual counselling is available through the CAL counsellor upon referral by your CAL advisor. Learn more about the referral process here.

Group Counselling

There are a number of group counselling options for CAL registrants, facilitated by the CAL counsellor that are designed to provide a safe and supportive environment for students with a lived experience of disability to receive support.

3 groups are offered on a rotating basis:

Medical Services

See a doctor or nurse at Health & Counselling clinics if your health is being impacted, or if you are seeking a medical referral to a physician specialist.

My SSP

Dolwnload my SSP to access 24/7 crisis support, or call or chat to schedule an appointment with a counsellor in the community (close to home). You can make an appointment requesting specific counsellor options, such as a counsellor with similar lived experience as you, and you can also chat with a counsellor for advice if you are supporting someone else in distress.

It's always advised to have the app on your phone for if and when you need it.

Booking with your own General Practitioner (Physician), Psychologist, or Psychiatrist

You can have your own General Practitioner, Psychologist, or Psychiatrist complete forms to get documentation for CAL.

If this option is available for you, this is the better option since your own General Practitioner, Psychologist, or Psychiatrist will know you better if they have been seeing you for a while.

Booking with a doctor at Health & Counselling

If you are unable to book with your own General Practitioner, Psychologist, or Psychiatrist, you can book with a doctor at a Health & Counselling clinic.
