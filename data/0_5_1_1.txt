Nazafarin Esfandiari (She/Hers)

My name is Nazafarin and I’m the new Hi-FIVE Coordinator. A bit about myself, I’m a third-year student at SFU, majoring in BSc Health Sciences, Population and Quantitative Health Sciences Concentration. I’m passionate about mental health, health communications, and working with volunteers and peers in different fields. I believe that an important part of health information is how we communicate and promote it to the public so that everyone can benefit from it, and this is specifically true about mental health because of all the stigma and misinformation around it. I hope we can achieve this goal as a team and as a community, and I look forward to meeting and working with you all!

There are a lot of ways to contribute to the movement of eliminating mental health stigma across campus.
