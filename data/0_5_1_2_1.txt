The Co-Curricular Record (CCR) is the reference document for your co-curricular involvement at SFU, listing your activities outside of classes (e.g., leadership programs and volunteer roles). The Co-Curricular Record is an official university document easily accessible via myInvolvement.

Activities must meet the Co-Curricular Record Eligibility Criteria in order to appear on your record. You can view a list of activities currently recognized on the CCR here.

If you are involved in a program that you think is suitable for the Co-Curricular Record, please ask your program supervisor to contact the CCR Administration Team at ccr-admin@sfu.ca. 

See all CCR opportunities >


Activities are added by the third week of every term. Please refer to the schedule below based on when you have completed your role or program. Dates are subject to change and will be updated accordingly . 

If you participated in an opportunity eligible for Co-Curricular Record credit and you don’t see your credits in MyInvolvement, please ask your program supervisor to contact the CCR Administration Team at ccr-admin@sfu.ca. If your supervisor is not available, you may reach out to us directly.
