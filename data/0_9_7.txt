In partnership with Transforming Inquiry into Learning (TILT) & Teaching and SFU Health Promotion, Tools for Well-being in the Classroom (TWC) is a Well-being in Learning Environments initiative that builds on the work that faculty members and other instructors are already doing to support student learning and well-being.

Faculty members, instructors, and TAs/TMs are invited to try out quick strategies to support well-being in their own classes, tutorials, and learning environments, and have their students participate in a survey to evaluate its impact. An additional goal of this initiative is to expand the network of faculty, instructors, and TAs/TMs interested in exploring strategies that support well-being in learning environments.

Everyone’s well-being has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and incidents on the world stage; each person has and continues to experience this differently. The pandemic has exacerbated mental health stressors. Youth aged 18-30 have been particularly likely to report increased anxiety and stress in 2020 (Samji et al., 2021). Students at post-secondary institutions also reported increased stress as we all navigated the switch from in-person to remote teaching, along with other pandemic-related educational complications (Rashid & Di Genova, 2020). Instructors, faculty, and TAs/TMs play an important role in creating conditions that support student well-being, and with that student learning, engagement, and retention.

For more information about the impact of well-being on student success, and ways that instructors can affect both, see this project rationale.

Letter of recognition from Transforming Inquiry into Learning & Teaching (TILT) and SFU Health Promotion

“It was really nice to have a prompt to help get conversations with new people started. It made it feel less intimidating to talk to someone new. I also loved how open the prompt were, allowing us to engage as lightly or deeply as we liked. I feel like we often started out saying pretty standard things like being stressed about exams, but after a while people started sharing more personal and meaningful things about themselves. The activity made me feel like a part of a community.”
