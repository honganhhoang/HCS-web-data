Please note that our international student advisors do not advise on academic-related and permanent residency inquiries.

To learn more about academic advising, see Quick Links.  For information about applying for permanent residency in Canada, please visit the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada(IRCC) website. 

International Student Advising provides guidance on immigration and transition related issues such as, but not limited to: study permits, visas, work eligibility, enrollment requirements for international students, medical insurance and the Canadian healthcare system, taxes information for international students, intercultural transition support, referrals, and more.

International Student Experience Support is your accessible one-stop service available at any point in your academic journey at SFU. As an international student, this is your space to get support on your transition into university in Canada and ask questions about any aspect of your student life outside of class.
