Bouncing Forward is a free, non-credit Canvas Resilience Training designed to help you build resilience and enhance your well-being.

It can be challenging to balance multiple roles in our daily lives, which is why we've created an online resilience training to help you do so. Bouncing Forward aims to teach you how to build your personal resilience, identify and access resources, and improve your well-being. You will be able to describe how resilience can help you be more flexible and adapt to change, examine the relationship between stress, success, well-being, and resilience, and practice resilience-building strategies. This training takes approximately three hours to complete.
