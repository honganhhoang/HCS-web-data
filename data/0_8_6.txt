Since 2019, the SFU Health Promotion team and the Faculty of Applied Sciences (including the Dean and Associate Deans, faculty and student affairs representatives) have been working in partnership to enhance student well-being.  

“The Health Promotion team at Health and Counselling is supportive, kind, and models a commitment to health promotion in everything that they do from email communication to the way that they hold meetings. It continues to be a pleasure to work with the team. Our vision to promote the health and wellness of our students has been translated into tangible strategies including a student wellness survey and wellness curriculum. We are excited to work with Health and Counselling as well as faculty, staff, students to support student health and wellness. I’m looking forward to being able to work with Health and Counselling and staff, faculty, and students to develop and share innovative resources and supports for student health and wellness.” 

- David Le, former Student Affairs Coordinator, Health and Wellness, Faculty of Applied Sciences 

Since 2015, Health Promotion has partnered with Paola Ardiles in the Faculty of Health Sciences to offer an experiential learning course through which Masters of Public Health students work in groups using an equity centered design framework to develop solutions to enhance student well-being at SFU. Many of these solutions have since been implemented, including the development of a graduate student lounge in Health Sciences that was designed with well-being in mind.

Health and well-being are essential elements for effective learning. In partnership with the Teaching and Learning Centre, we work with instructional staff to create conditions for well-being within learning environments.

Well-designed spaces have the ability to positively impact mood, social connectedness, and learning. We work with a variety of partners to enhance the physical spaces on campus to support well-being.
