The First Nations, Métis & Inuit Student Association (FNMISA) is where the medicine happens. It is an Indigenous student-run group within the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS). The FNMISA’s purposes are to provide a variety of supports and resources to First Nations, Métis, and Inuit (FNMI) students. This includes support and preservation of the various cultural diversities of FNMI peoples, to advocate for services and resources necessary for FNMI students to succeed at Simon Fraser University (SFU), and to promote increased awareness of FNMI cultures and issues to the SFU Community.

To be a member of the FNMISA, one must have:

FNMISA Members shall have full and equal participation rights of the fulfillment of quorum, access to FNMISA space and resources, motioning and voting at all FNMISA meetings, elections and eligibility for FNMISA Council, voting during FNMISA referenda, access to the open inspection of any administration documents of the FNMISA, upon request addressed to the FNMISA Council, and to request a copy of the FNMISA Constitution and Bylaws of association.
