EFAP counselling can help with a wide range of issues including, but not limited to:

Users will also have access to Homewood Health's network of registered licensed counsellors who identify as having extensive experience in counselling clients within the Indigenous community, as well as many counsellors identifying as experts in Inuit, Metis, First Nations and Residential Schools, LGBTQ2+ and BIPOC communities.

For users who wish to access support through a more culturally traditional approach with Elders and/or Knowledge Keepers through Homewood Health, they may call the Intake Centre with a self-identified Elder and/or Knowledge Keeper of their choosing. In circumstances where the Elder is not self-identified at the time of intake, Homewood Health would offer to connect the user to one of their clinical experts who are specialized in Indigenous Culture.

You may access Pathfinder on your smartphone, tablet or desktop (Invitation Code: SFU522).
