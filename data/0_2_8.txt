i For the latest updates and specific information on COVID-19 including impacts on medical insurance, please refer to the COVID-19 FAQ for International Students page.

You must have medical insurance for the entire duration of your studies. The Canadian health system provides a high standard of health care, but care is very expensive if you are not insured.
