"Over 1000 students were reached through in-person events, and over 3000 were engaged via synchronous and asynchronous virtual programs, outreach and communication materials."

SFU Health Promotion leads and facilitates systemic action to create healthy settings by embedding mental health and well-being literacy as a core commitment within Health & Counselling’s Student Mental Health & Well-being Framework.
