To promote social connection between students, try facilitating these quick class check-in activities at the beginning of the hour.

In small or mid-sized classes, invite everyone in the room say 1-2 words about how they are doing that day (are they tired, happy, excited, nervous, etc).

In very large classes you can use iClickers to do a multiple choice check in. Ask students to pick one of six options that best reflects how they feel that day. Options could include good, tired, overwhelmed, excited, stressed, happy etc. Alternatively, invite students to share their response with the person beside them.
