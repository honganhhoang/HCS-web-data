Better Coping Skills is a group offered to students who are looking to make improvements to their well-being. Each participant will be asked to try a new goal this term that promotes healthier coping with student life.

This 4-session group runs twice during the term and participants are encouraged to attend all four modules. If space allows, participants can continue in the second set if they wish to do so.
