WHAT IS DUNGEONS & WORRY DRAGONS (D&WD)?

D&WD is a Therapeutically-Applied Tabletop Roleplaying Game Group. It is a term-long counselling group that requires registration to join. During the group, participants play in a short Dungeons & Dragons campaign facilitated by a Registered Clinical Counsellor trained in the therapeutic application of tabletop roleplaying games. As this is a process-based group (meaning your growth and improvements result mostly from your interactions with others in the group), significant participation from participants is expected and encouraged!

This group can be of benefit for many reasons, but is especially geared towards students having some kind of difficulty with social functioning – social anxiety, neurodivergence, trouble initiating or maintaining relationships, loneliness, etc. 

No prior knowledge of D&D is necessary!

In addition to experiencing less frequent and/or less intense social anxiety symptoms (on average, previous participants have improved by about 20%), students who participate fully in D&WD can expect to experience growth or improvement in the following areas of their social functioning:
