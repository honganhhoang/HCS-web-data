Student life can be stressful and overwhelming, but you don't have to face it alone. There are supports available to you from the Indigenous Student Centre and SFU, to help you through your emotional, physical, spiritual and intellectual health journey.

Everyone has a different approach for leading a healthy lifestyle, including their physical, mental, spiritual and emotional health. At the ISC we host a variety of wholistic wellness programs in order to support you in the best way you see fit. Checkout our Calender of Events to learn more about upcoming programs. Have a suggestion about a type of program you would like to see at the ISC? Please fill out our feedback form or email iscadmin@sfu.ca.

Sign up for the Wellness Program to join our online community and in-person programs.

Get connected with one of our Indigenous Clinical Counsellors for a one-on-one appointment or workshop.

Attend an Elders Program Drop-in for a casual conversation and knowledge sharing opportunity.

Join a Cultural Connections workshop to learn new skills and visit with community.

SFU Health and Counselling Services has a Black Counsellor, Tricia Kay Williams, available for drop-ins (booking needed in advance). For more information about how to access Black Mental Health supports and other BIPOC-specific supports, please visit the HCS Black Student Supports page.
