A student’s behaviour is disruptive: examples include yelling or refusing to follow direction; sending numerous repetitive emails or phone calls. 

Single instance
Clearly identify expectations for behaviour and consequences, preferably without an audience, and/or tell them to leave the office/classroom.

Repeated instances after discussion
Report behaviour to Student Conduct Office and/or Campus Public Safety.
