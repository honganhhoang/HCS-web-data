In crisis? Call 9-1-1 for medical emergencies and missing persons. For crisis or suicide, call 1 (800) 784-2433. Online options are also here to support you:

Urgent and Primary Care Centres (UPCC) provide patient-centred care by a team of health care providers, including family doctors, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, social workers and clerical staff.

They are for people who have an urgent but non-life threatening injury and/or illness, and need to be seen by a doctor or nurse practitioner within 12-24 hours. Some examples of injuries/illnesses that may be treated at a UPCC are: sprains and strains, high fever, worsening chronic disease, minor infections, and new or worsening pain.

UPCCs provide team-based, everyday health care. They provide urgent care when you are unable to see your family doctor or nurse practitioner and your injury/illness does not require emergency attention. Please visit an emergency department if you have a critical or life-threatening condition.

If possible, bring photo ID, your BC Services Card or CareCard and a list of any medications you are taking. If available, please also bring any Medical Orders of Scope of Treatment (MOST) forms or have a family member bring them in. 

We also suggest you minimize bringing personal belongings or valuables to the Emergency Department.
