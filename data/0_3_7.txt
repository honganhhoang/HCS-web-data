Various experiences contribute to shaping our identities, influencing our feelings of belonging, support, and connection to community.

Below you will find a list of resources that may offer support to individual and collective identities.

This list is not all-encompassing of the identities and experiences affecting people’s lives, and each resource list is not all-inclusive. 

This list is continuously updated as we build to our identity-based resources on and off campus. 

Use the Power Flower to reflect on your socio-cultural identities and the roles your power and privilege play in your life 🌼
