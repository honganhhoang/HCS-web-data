Counselling is a tool for individuals experiencing a difficult situation to resolve their emotional distress and enjoy greater wellness.

Health Benefits has partnered with Pacific Blue Cross (PBC) to administer the Mental Wellness and Counselling (MWC) benefit  to First Nations in BC.​ You can access the Mental Health Benefit Schedule here​.

For more information about the updates to the Mental Wellness and Counselling program, please see a Client frequently asked questions resource here​.



Your benefit covers counselling services from a qualified mental health provider. Mental health providers include psychologists, clinical counsellors and social workers.



The mental health provider must be registered with Health Benefits. Options to find a registered mental health provider:

You can find detailed information about your mental health claims through your PBC Member P​rofile, which you can access online.

You must see a provider who is registered with the Health Benefits Program to receive coverage for your counselling services.​

If you need travel assistance to access counselling, please contact the Medical Transportation Program (email: Transportation@fnha.ca ; phone: 1-855-550-5454). 

Note: Medical Transportation coverage may be available for trips that meet Medical Transportation criteria. Learn more about your Medical Transportation benefits here.​

If you prefer virtual appointments, talk to your provider about Telehealth options. See the Telehealth ​page or the Telehealth for Mental Health poster.

1. Tell your provider that you have coverage through the Health Benefits Program when scheduling your first app​ointment. 

2. Your first appointment is about determining if the provider is the right fit for you. You can change to another registered provider at any time.

3. Cancel your appointment ahead of time if you can no longer make it. Health Benefits does not pay for missed appointments and your provider may charge you for the cost of your appointment if you do not show up.
