The ISC recognizes the value and importance of Elders and Knowledge Keepers within communities. ISC Elders are from diverse backgrounds, hold distinct traditional knowledge, and are available to provide students guidance and support.

Students can stay connected with the ISC Elders through weekly Elder Program Drop-ins. ISC Elders also connect with the SFU community by supporting university events and initiatives.

No sessions over Summer 2025 semester.  

Join Russell on Friday June 20, 2025 from 2pm-4pm in AQ 3144 for an opportunity to drum or have a casual conversation. Food and drums will be provided, and we hope to see you there.   

Drop-ins are available for Indigenous students on Wednesdays.  Please see the calendar for exact dates.   Bring your project you are working on or come and participate in the session offered.

Get to know more about the Elders and Knowledge Keepers who support the Indigenous Student Centre through the Elders Program.

The ISC coordinates requests for Elder support for students, staff, and faculty from across the SFU community. Learn more about how you can invite an Elder to open and support your event.
