"It is widely accepted that health and well-being are essential elements for effective learning" (El Ansari and Stock, 2010).

When we support well-being in our learning environments, we can better support our students in reaching academic success. Read about the history and research that informs this project.  

The Well-being in Learning Environments project is a network of SFU faculty members and instructional staff committed to creating conditions for well-being in learning environments. See examples of actions they’re taking.

This project is an initiative of SFU Health Promotion and the CEE (Centre for Educational Excellence.

As part of the Student Experience Initiative, SFU Health Promotion, Health and Counselling Services and  Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies developed a faculty and graduate student version of the Well-being through the Supervisory Process: A Guide to Action. Contributions from SFU faculty champions and graduate students make this framework an excellent tool for conversation.
