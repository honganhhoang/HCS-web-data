During the month of June we celebrate National Indigenous History Month and recognize National Indigenous Peoples Day on June 21. On these days we celebrate the cultures and contributions of the First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada. 

The day was first celebrated in 1996, after it was proclaimed that year by then Governor General of Canada Roméo LeBlanc, to be celebrated annually on 21 June. These days are great opportunities to acknowledge Indigenous Peoples, to learn about their histories, cultures and ways of life.

Cultural appropriation means to use or replicate aspects of a people's traditions and culture without approval.

Practice cultural appreciation instead!

Step 1: Educate yourself on the significance of an item/design.

Step 2: Buy from Indigenous artists.

Throughout the month of June 2022, the ISC and FNMISA hosted numerous events to celebrate and honour Indigenous Peoples and cultures. This included ArtsLIVE performances to highlight Indigenous talent, namely: Kevin Kelly and Michael Kelly-Gabriel, Eagle Song Dancers, Madeline McCallum, Sandy Scofield, Wild Moccasin Dancers, Git Hayetsk Dancers, Alex Wells and Nyla Carpentier.

Offering the chance to reconnect with nature and the land known as Lhuḵw’lhuḵw’áyten (Sḵwx̱wú7mesh placename for Burnaby Mountain), Gary George led participants on a nature walk.

Finally, ending the month off with the inaugural Indigenous Market at SFU! With 30+ Indigenous vendors, artists, makers and entrepreneurs were able to showcase their gifts.
