Union Mandate:
    The SFU Disability and Neurodiversity Alliance (DNA) is a student-led network of community members who identify as disabled, autistic, neurodivergent, Deaf, mad and/or as having a disability, chronic illness, long-term condition, or mental illness. We work together to create campus change, address ableism, and promote disability justice while opposing oppression in all forms. Accessibility is an important issue within our membership and we are committed to addressing this within the educational setting and beyond. As a constituency group under the Simon Fraser Student Society, we serve as the official voice for disabled and neurodivergent undergraduates.
