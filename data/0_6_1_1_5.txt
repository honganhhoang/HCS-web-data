The Indigenous Student Centre (ISC) supports the journey of Indigenous students at SFU from enrollment to convocation.

ISC programs ensure that Indigenous students have access to information and resources they may need to achieve academic goals, as well as to maintain balance during busy student life. 

Programs and resouces can be accessed in-person or on Zoom (by request). Check our Calendar of Events for more details, including location, times, or Zoom links.

All programs, services, and events are offered for currently enrolled, self-identified Indigenous (First Nations, Métis, and Inuit) students at SFU.  

This Zoom information will be used across all hybrid programs and services and will be updated semesterly.
