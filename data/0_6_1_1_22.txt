The ISC understands the value and importance of celebrating our diverse cultures and histories. At the ISC, we celebrate our cultures every day, while recognizing community events and awareness campaigns that honour our history, culture and ancestors. We welcome all members of the SFU community to attend and support these events and campaigns.  

Please note, that although we recognize these community dates, the ISC does not necessarily host events for each day. Refer to our Calendar of Events for an up to date schedule.

Visit the Health and Wellbeing page to learn more.

Should you require further information please contact iscproj@sfu.ca or check out our Calendar of Events for more details.
