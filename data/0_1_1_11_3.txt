At times, you’ve probably noticed students who seem to be in distress. You may have worried about them and hoped they’re getting the help they need — but not known whether you can or should do anything about it. Your observations and actions can help connect students to the many available resources at SFU.

This Response Guide is intended to help you identify and potentially assist students in distress. You don’t need to take on the role of a counsellor, but you can play a key role in connecting students with resources and support.

Contact with the Office of Student Support, Rights & Responsibilities for students exhibiting concerning behaviour.

Here are some examples of behaviours you may observe, and questions you might ask.
