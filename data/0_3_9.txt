Simon Fraser University is responsible for ensuring that persons with verified disabilities have equitable access and opportunity to the programs, services, and facilities offered by the institution. The Centre for Accessible Learning (CAL)* is mandated with implementing many aspects of this responsibility, including the determination of a student’s entitlement to accommodations on the basis of their disability. Accommodations are intended to reasonably offset barriers resulting from the impact of the student’s disability in the academic environment while also not compromising the academic standards of the University.

The process of registering with the CAL takes time and so we encourage students to contact the office as soon as possible. The general steps include (1) completing an Application for Services form, (2) submitting current documentation; and, (3) attending an intake appointment with a Disability Access Advisor. Students may choose to first attend an information session to better understand the role and services of the Centre before deciding whether to proceed with registration. 

To assist with timely registration, students are advised to fully review the documentation requirements.

The Centre appreciates that personal privacy is of utmost concern to students and we maintain a strict confidentiality policy, in accordance with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act of BC.
