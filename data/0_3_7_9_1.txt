Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM) is a month-long series of engagement opportunities hosted by the Sexual Violence Support & Prevention Office (SVSPO) in collaboration with SFU and FIC partners every January. The purpose of SAAM is to raise awareness about sexual violence and to empower SFU and FIC students, faculty, staff, and administrators to engage with this complex topic in meaningful ways.

Events for SAAM 2025 will be posted here starting in the fall.

We would like to recognize and thank the members of the SAAM 2024 Advisory Committee, who contributed their time, energy, and commitment to the SFU community: Aarushi Aggarwal, Fereshteh Rashed, J.J. Watson-MacKay, Jonas Worth, Jonathan Mendel, Jude Mah, Marcel DaSilva, Matt Horrigan, Paola Quirós-Cruz, Sarah Ahmed, Simmi Dhaliwal, Theodore Cosco. 

The SAAM Advisory Committee consists of undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff from SFU.
