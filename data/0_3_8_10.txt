Join this gender-inclusive safe space for students who have been impacted by sexualized violence. This group meets weekly (for 8 weeks) to discuss impacts and practice coping strategies over art-making and tea.

Participants will be welcomed each week and safety in the group will be established and prioritized. Participation can be helpful and lead to positive change, however, members will not be pressured to share personal experiences. All levels of participation will be respected. This is a trauma-informed group.

Participants may expect to learn about trauma and recovery, coping skills, and emotional regulation. A caring, compassionate and safe space will be held and created for the weekly sessions and discussions.  Shereen Khan is a registered clinical counsellor working with the Sexual Violence Support & Prevention Office, supporting students in the capacity on their journey of healing from the impacts of trauma. 

Advanced sign up required. Link or location will be provided to students before the first session. Contact: shereen_khan@sfu.ca for inquiries and to register for the upcoming sessions.
