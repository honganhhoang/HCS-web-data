The Office of Student Support, Rights & Responsibilities is a resource for students, faculty and staff. Students can find out about their responsibilities and rights as members of the SFU community, and learn about the supports available to them. Faculty and staff can share concerns and consult with the office to ensure appropriate responses and level of supports are provided to students. 

Find out more about your responsibilities and rights, and the supports available to you as a member of the SFU community. 

Our case managers can meet with you by appointment on any of SFU's three campuses or meet with you virtually (online remote appointment).

Availability:
Monday-Friday, 9am-4:30pm (excluding statutory holidays).
Appointments may be held outside of these hours, by request.
