F T I

The ISC works in collaboration with Academics First Tutoring Program to pair students with tutors. Get paired with a tutor today to support your learning goals. This service is available during the Fall and Spring semesters only.

Tutor Requests are accepted for lower level (100-200 level) courses and will hopefully be fulfilled as soon as possible. Tutoring is no cost to the student as the ISC will provide an hour of tutoring per week (up to 13 weeks) for currently enrolled First Nations, Métis, and Inuit students.

Please note that tutoring assistance is for course content only. If you require assistance with writing (essays, formatting, structure), please click here to book a consultation with the SFU Library's Student Learning Commons (SLC). For writing assistance, you may also use the WriteAway program. 

Contact our office with any questions about the program by phone at 778-782-6929 or askisc@sfu.ca
