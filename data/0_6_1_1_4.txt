The Indigenous Student Centre (ISC) wants to hear from you, the SFU's Indigenous student community. This is a space for you to share your questions, concerns, or feedback with the ISC. 

We want to hear from you about your SFU experience and create a safe space for Indigenous students to make the most out of their university journey. The questionnaire below will ask about your experience, anything you would like to share with ISC Staff and any accomplishments that you want to celebrate.

Most questions are optional, and you do not need to fill out every one, we want you to use this form to share with the ISC, what you are comfortable with. All responses will be kept confidential within the ISC Team, unless otherwise identified in the form below.
