The workplace environment may contribute positively to mental well-being.  However, at times, the workplace may also contribute to mental illness either as a direct source of stress, depression and anxiety, or by exacerbating issues that exist in other parts of one’s life.

If not well managed, workplace-related mental health issues can lead to increased rates or levels of illness, and may result in absenteeism, tension and conflicts between colleagues, deteriorating employee performance and reduced morale.

 

Awareness, understanding and knowledge of mental health issues may help you move towards achieving health and a sense of emotional well-being.
