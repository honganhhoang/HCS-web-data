Health & Counselling at Simon Fraser University (SFU) is offering flexible pre-doctoral supplemental practicum placements to doctoral students in counselling psychology. It is ideally suited for students looking for additional practicum hours primarily in interventions prior to applying for residency programs. Our advanced generalist program provides either an 8 or 12 month part time placement or a 5 month summer intensive placement, with some flexibility in the length of placement. Full supervision will be provided, with the required one hour of supervision for every four hours of therapy provided by a B.C. Registered Psychologist, with at least half of the supervision being individual supervision. The placements typically starts at the beginning of September, with the summer intensive practicum starts at the beginning of April.

Our practicum placement provides training in the core functional skill areas found in the Schedule H requirements of College of Psychologists of British Columbia. The goal of the program is to provide practicum students with an opportunity to experience a diverse and comprehensive set of learning and professional activities to enhance their counselling knowledge and skills. Pre-doctoral practicum students will gain the kind of broad generalist experience that will prepare them to work in a future residency program.

Ideally, we are looking for pre-doctoral students who are already masters level clinical counsellors and have some experience in risk assessment. At a minimum we are looking for those who have successfully completed their foundational pre-doctoral coursework in intervention and assessment.  

PLEASE NOTE: Applications should be sent via email to adassist@sfu.ca. Reference letters should be sent by the reference writers via email to adassist@sfu.ca. Mock demonstration videos should be sent via mail on a USB drive.
