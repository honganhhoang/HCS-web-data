Protect yourself from respiratory illness
Flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The best way to prevent flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year.

Everyone 6 months and older can get a flu vaccine
All B.C. residents 6 months and older can get a free flu vaccine in the fall and winter.

It's especially important to get a flu vaccine if you're:

Under 5 years or over 65 years
Pregnant
Living in long-term care or assisted living
Immunocompromised or have a chronic illness
Enhanced vaccines are available for seniors
To help create a stronger immune response, enhanced vaccines are available for people 65 years and older. 

Flu can cause serious illness in children
Younger children are at higher risk from respiratory illnesses like flu. To prevent serious illness, get your child immunized every year.

It's safe for your child to get their flu vaccine at the same time as other vaccines.

The vaccine is usually given as 1 dose. Children under 9 who have never had a flu vaccine need 2 doses, 4 weeks between each dose. The second dose is important to raise their level of protection. ​
