If so, we have a free service called the Autism Mentorship Initiative (AMI) designed especially for you!

The AMI starts every September (fall term) and runs until the following May (end of spring term). The goals of the service are to enhance your social experience and connection to the University community and to help support your academic success.

You will be matched up with a SFU student who has received specialized training as a mentor. Individual circumstances may vary, but on average, you will meet one-on-one with your mentor about once per week, for 1-2 hours at a time.

You and your mentor will identify areas of interest or concern to explore over the course of each semester. Focus areas may include topics such as: improving your academic skills (e.g., effectively structuring your study time); communication and interpersonal skills (e.g., how to talk with a professor or another student); or finding out about campus activities and resources; or the two of you may meet up simply to connect, talk about life at school, and enjoy the university campus. The theme of these weekly meetings can be fluid, adjusting to your evolving interests or emerging concerns.

To help us develop the best program possible you will be asked to complete some questionnaires throughout your involvement with the AMI. Participation in this is not mandatory. 

If you are a current or incoming SFU student diagnosed with autism and would like to learn more or apply to participate in AMI, please fill out the following form.  A Program Coordinator will contact you directly in response to your inquiry.
