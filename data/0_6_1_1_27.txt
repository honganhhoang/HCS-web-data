MMIWG2S stands for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit Peoples, and works towards raising awareness and advocating for the end of violence againt Indigenous Women. Throughout the year, we hold events in honour of our stolen sisters.

May 5th is National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People (MMIWG2S). On this day we remember the people who have lost their lives to colonial, gender-based violence, and their families and communities that live daily with the grief of losing loved ones.  

The SFU Library has created more resources about National MMIWG2S Awareness Day here

This day is also known as Red Dress Day. Red Dress Day started as a campaign entitled, The REDress Project, that launched in 2014 by Métis artist Jamie Black and has been used to symbolize the thousands of MMIWG2S. The ISC remembers and honours all our Indigenous loved ones who have been murdered and gone missing. We encourage others to join in raising awareness on this day.
