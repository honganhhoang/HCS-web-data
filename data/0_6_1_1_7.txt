ISC's Cultural Connections program is an opportunity for Indigenous Students to connect and engage with cultural and artistic activities. From casual gatherings where students can share their own artistic projects to workshops lead by local artists.

Self-identified Indigenous Students can participate in Cultural Connections each week. Be sure to check out the ISC Calendar of Events or the ISC Newsletter for updates and registration links.
