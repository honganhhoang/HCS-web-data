I 

Identity, Currently Offered

This is a group for folks who are questioning their gender and/or sexuality. 

2SLGBTQIA+ Questioning Group includes folks who are anywhere along a questioning process, from “I sense something within myself, but have no idea on how to explore this” to “I know exactly who I am and how I got here”. Diversity of identities and experiences are welcome as this group aims to be a collaborative space where community comes together to support and learn from each other.

If interested, please email cprac_240@sfu.ca.
