The purpose of the Student Mental Health & Well-being Framework at SFU is to enhance student well-being, mental health, and health equity through collaborative action. It aims to create systems, cultures, curriculum, and programs that support students to thrive academically and make a positive impact in the community. The framework outlines SFU's commitment to advancing student mental health and well-being in partnership with others across the institution. It serves as a guide for internal use in Health & Counselling Services (HCS) and as a planning tool for the university as a whole. The framework aligns with organizational goals and commitments, including SFU's strategic plan and the SFU People Plan. It is guided by principles such as promoting health in everyday operations, building cultures of care, holistic conceptualizations of health, centering student voice, systemic action, building on strengths, equity and justice, decolonization and Indigenization, evidence-informed practice, and ecological and social sustainability. The framework outlines strategic action areas to address student mental health and well-being, including policies and organizational systems, creating physical spaces for well-being, embedding well-being in learning environments, promoting equity, connection, and inclusion, enhancing mental health literacy, and providing support services. The framework also includes key indicators to measure progress towards improved student well-being and health equity at SFU.
