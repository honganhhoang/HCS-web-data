Abstinence and the "rhythm" method were the only legal methods of birth control in Canada during the Centennial in 1967. Condoms could only be marketed for the prevention of disease. People could be prosecuted for teaching or providing other methods of preventing pregnancies, and terminating a pregnancy was illegal.
