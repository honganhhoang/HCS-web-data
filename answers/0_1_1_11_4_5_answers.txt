Substance use disorders are often seen with other mental health conditions and the term “concurrent disorder” is used to identify this combination. A significant risk factor for developing a problem with substance use is having symptoms, or a family history, of another mental health condition such as depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder. In some instances, people may use drugs or alcohol to try to control symptoms of these other conditions, which can lead to problems with substance use and make symptoms of mental illness worse. The treatment for concurrent disorders addresses the symptoms of substance use disorder and other mental health conditions at the same time.

Substance use disorder is diagnosed based on a set of behaviors or criteria related to the use of the substance. The severity of the condition is determined by how many criteria are met. A mild condition meets two or three criteria, moderate condition meets four or five criteria, and a severe substance use problem meets six or more criteria.

The process of treatment for substance use disorder involves managing withdrawal symptoms, followed by an intensive period of treatment consisting of psycho-education and counselling. This is then followed by aftercare, which may include counselling or attending peer support groups. Treatment may also involve medication to control withdrawal symptoms or cravings. Other approaches include residential or outpatient treatment, individual or group therapy, self-help or peer led support groups, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle through nutrition, physical activity, and proper sleep. Planning ahead for triggering situations and involving friends and family in the "get-better" plan can also be helpful. Continued support through self-help groups and resources is important for long-term recovery.
