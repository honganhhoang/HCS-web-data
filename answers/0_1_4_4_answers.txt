To participate in group counseling at SFU, students with ADHD can contact their CAL disability advisor and express interest in joining the 'Experiencing ADHD' group. The advisor will then forward an email referral with instructions on how to book an intake appointment with the group facilitator. Following the intake appointment, students will meet with the facilitator for a screening meeting to determine if the group is a good fit. It is important to consider the mental and emotional energy required for consistent participation, as space in the groups is limited and once filled, new members will not be admitted for that semester.
