- A policy states a goal or purpose, explains why the university is doing something and what it wants to achieve, and contains principles to guide decision-making.
- A procedure provides specific direction on how to implement the policy, assigns responsibilities, and includes processes for day-to-day operational decision-making to achieve institutional goals.

6.
A bicameral governance system has two governing bodies, the Board of Governors (BoG) and the Senate. British Columbia’s University Act establishes the powers and responsibilities of the BoG and the Senate. The BoG is responsible for the management, administration, and control of the property, revenue, business, and affairs of the university. The Senate reviews and approves policies related to academic matters of the university.

7.
Policy development resides with a Vice-President or other “policy owner” (e.g. the BoG has its own policies that reside with the University Secretary).

Community consultation is conducted by giving the highest level of consideration to the people most impacted, engaging with formal stakeholder groups or informal groups, and conducting robust community-wide consultations when a policy has wider implications.

11.
A policy takes effect at SFU when it is approved by the Board of Governors. If the policy is related to an academic matter, it must also be approved by the Senate.

Approved policies can be accessed on SFU's Policy Gazette.
