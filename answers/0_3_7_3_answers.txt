Jennifer's professional approach to counselling emphasizes a braided practice that honors Indigenous knowledge, a strength-based person/community centered approach, and relevant, respectful, mainstream therapeutic orientations that strive for holistic balance. She believes in the importance of wrap-around care, supporting connections with Elders and cultural teachings, and exploration of identity development. Her work is grounded in Indigenous ways of knowing that stress the importance of reciprocity, relevance, responsibility, and relationships.
