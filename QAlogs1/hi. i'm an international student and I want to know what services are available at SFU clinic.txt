Question: What medical services are available for graduate students at SFU?
Answer: Doctors and nurses are available for a range of medical services, advice, and care. Booking with a clinic on campus is particularly helpful if you are attending SFU from another province or country, don’t have a family doctor during your time in graduate school, or commute from another location in Metro Vancouver. Medical appointments can be booked to meet in-person at Burnaby or Vancouver campus, and tele/virtual health visits are available as needed to accommodate your schedule and location.
