Question: What role does relaxation play in managing anxiety?
Answer: Relaxation is one of the most straightforward and effective ways to manage anxiety. Maintaining good nutrition, staying active, and sticking to a regular sleep schedule can also help relieve tension and stress, making a person less vulnerable to anxiety and its symptoms. Practicing low and slow breathing before entering stressful situations can help reduce anxiety. Frequent, short "stress breaks" throughout the day can prevent physical tension from accumulating and contributing to anxiety. Involving friends and family in the treatment plan can provide support and help manage anxiety.
