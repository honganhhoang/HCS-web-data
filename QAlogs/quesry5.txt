What is the process for joining the group counseling sessions for students with ADHD?
To join the group counseling sessions for students with ADHD, students can contact their CAL disability advisor and express interest in participating in the group. The advisor will then provide an email referral with instructions on how to book an intake appointment with the group facilitator. After completing these steps, students will have a 30-minute group screening meeting with the facilitator to determine if the group is a good fit. It is important to consider the limited space in the groups, as once filled, the group will be closed for the semester with a waitlist created for future offerings. New members will not be admitted once the groups begin to maintain safety and consistency for existing members.
