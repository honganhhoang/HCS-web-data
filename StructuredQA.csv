Symptoms of bipolar disorder are cyclical with an irregular pattern of depressive and manic episodes over time; because of this, it sometimes takes time to come to the correct diagnosis. In addition, the symptoms of this disorder can mimic other disorders (e.g., hyperthyroidism), so it’s important to seek medical attention in order to rule out other medical conditions. 

Diagnosis is through face-to-face evaluation by a psychiatrist or other allied health care professional with specialized expertise in mood disorders, often using clinical tools such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). There is no simple diagnostic test available at this time - for example a brain scan or blood test – that specifically identifies bipolar disorder.",0_1_1_11_4_2,https://www.manulife.ca/personal/plan-and-learn/mental-health/conditions/bipolar-disorder.html
